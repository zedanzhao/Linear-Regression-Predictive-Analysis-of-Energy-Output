 # Linear Regression: Predictive Analysis of Energy Output in Combined Cycle Power Plants
This project centers around the analysis of the Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set, which spans six years (2006-2011) and includes key variables like temperature, ambient pressure, relative humidity, and exhaust vacuum to predict the net hourly electrical energy output of the plant. The primary analytical goal is to understand and predict the plant's energy output using various statistical and machine learning techniques. The project employs multiple algorithms, including simple and multiple linear regression, to identify significant predictors and understand their relationships with the energy output. Additionally, it explores nonlinear associations and interaction terms using polynomial models and interaction analysis. To enhance predictive accuracy, k-nearest neighbor (KNN) regression is also applied, comparing its performance with linear models. This comprehensive approach aims to model and predict power output effectively using a blend of linear, nonlinear, and nearest-neighbor methodologies.
